# c-algos #

c-algos is a collection of algorithms that I have implimented in C.


## QuickSort ##

quicksort.c contains an implimention of the QuickSort sorting algorithm.

It is WIP, and is known to be a bit buggy.

## Count Inversions ##

countInversions.c contains an algorithm which counts the number of inversions
in an array (basically, how sorted the array is).
